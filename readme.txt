This program consists of two parts. 

1) "WriteToDB"	- opens database and writes user's string to it.
2) "ReadFromDB"	- After the launch of this program, you will be asked to enter "user name", "database name" and "table name". If input is correct, the connection will be established. When connection completed, second window will appear, and you can ask the program to output data (strings) from your database's table.

P.S.
While the programm works, it was created 9 months ago. And it has a lot of problems. It is just my first C++/Qt/PostgreSQL program from scratch. I had to write it in a week, without any hard knowledge of Qt and Cpp.
